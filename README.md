> This snippet adds a [floating action button](https://material.io/guidelines/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html) that links to your Discord server! The look of it is quite similiar to the [Intercom live chat button](https://www.intercom.com/), which means many users are familiar with the concept of a chat button. The snippet is styled to imitate the Discord UI and works everywhere.
